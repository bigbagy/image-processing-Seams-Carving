Seams carving allows us to perform "content-aware" image resizing for both reduction and expansion and image object removal with seam carving operator. This allows image to be resized without losing or distorting meaningful content from scaling, sometimes called "content aware" resizing and removal.

This implementation of seam carving is written in Python using Numpy and OpenCV library.
