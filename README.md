This is a replication of research paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir on Seams Carving: http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/index.html

Seams Carving allows us to perform "content-aware" image resizing for both reduction/expansion and intelligent object removal. It allows image to be resized without losing or distorting meaningful content from scaling, sometimes called "content aware" resizing and removal.

This implementation of seam carving is written in Python using Numpy and OpenCV library.
